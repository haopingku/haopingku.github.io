              Since Javascript has no sleep function as other languages, and
              there is also no mutex, how does Javascript handle multithread?
              <code>setTimeout</code> is usually used for pending something
              to do in a while, how is it implemented?
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, Javascript is a single-threaded, non-blocking,
              asynchronous, concurrent runtime.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Single-threaded", sounds weird, right?
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's start with the concurrency model.
              Javscript's concurrency model is called <i>event loop</i>.
              An event is a context consists of code to be executed.
              And there is a queue of events in JS runtime.
              When <code>setTimeout</code> or other asynchronous functions
              (e.g. ajax functions) are called, JS runtime pushes an event
              into the queue.
              When JS runtime ends one event, it picks the top event in the
              queue and runs it, and so on.
              Notice that if an event takes a lot of time, JS runtime blocks
              on it because a context switch happens only when the last one
              is done.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only one call stack for function calls is needed, because
              context switch happends only when the call stack is empty.
              This is why JS is "single-threaded."
            </p>
            <p>
              For example the following code:
            </p>
<pre class="code code-javascript">
function busy() {
  while(true);
}
function sayHi() {
  console.log("hi");
}
console.log("start");
setTimeout(sayHi, 10);
busy();
</pre>
            <p>
              In other language using multithread, <code>sayHi</code> should
              be called in 10 milliseconds no matter how long <code>busy</code>
              takes.
              In event loop model, the event <code>busy</code> blocks the
              process, <code>sayHi</code> is called when <code>busy</code>
              ends, which will not happen in this case.
              This result doesn't change even we change 10 to 0.
            </p>
            <p>
              One adventage of event loop is that it's single-threaded, simple
              to implement.
              Furthermore, no mutex is needed, because context switchs happen
              only when an event is done, which also means no race condition.
              Furthermore, no sleep function means that Javascript runtime
              never blocks.
            </p>

              Below is a function I wrote for running a series of
              executions with time intervals between them.
              This acts like <code>sleep</code> function in other languages.
            </p>
<pre class="code code-javascript">
function series(...a) {
  a[0] &amp;&amp; setTimeout(series, parseInt(a[0]()), ...a.slice(1));
}

// print "1", "2", "3" with time interval of 1 second
series(
  () =&gt; { console.log(1); return 1000; },
  () =&gt; { console.log(2); return 1000; },
  () =&gt; { console.log(3);},
);
